A neutral stimulus that normally does not produce a response is repeatedly paired with a stimulus that naturally triggers a reaction. After several pairings, the neutral stimulus alone can bring about the same response as the original, natural stimulus.\n\nThe classic example is the work of Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist who studied dogs. He noticed that the dogs began to salivate when they heard the footsteps of the lab assistant, even before any food was presented. Pavlov had paired the sound of a bell with the presentation of meat, and eventually the bell itself caused the dogs to salivate. In this case, the bell was the neutral stimulus that became a conditioned stimulus, and the salivation was the conditioned response. \n\nClassical conditioning shows how organisms can learn to predict events in their environment, linking a previously irrelevant cue to an important: it helps explain many everyday behaviors, from emotional reactions to advertising effects.","question":"Define

Neurons are individual cells that receive, integrate, and transmit information. While they share some features with other body cells, their structure is highly specialized for communication.\n\nA neuron has three main regions:\n\n1. **The Soma, or Cell Body** – This contains the nucleus and much of the chemical machinery common to most cells. It also integrates incoming signals and makes decisions about whether the neuron should fire.\n\n2. **Dendrites** – These are branch-like extensions that sprout from the cell body. They serve as the input zone, receiving information from thousands of other neurons. Their name comes from the Greek word for “tree,” reflecting their many branches.\n\n3. **The Axon** – This is a long, thin fiber that transmits signals away from the soma toward other cells. Axons vary greatly in length. Some are microscopic, while others stretch up to several feet, such as those running from the spinal cord to the feet.\n\nMany axons are covered by a protective **myelin sheath**. Myelin is formed by special glial cells that wrap around the axon. It is rich in a white, fatty substance called **myelin**, which insulates the axon. This insulation dramatically increases the speed of neural impulses, much like coating on electrical wires. Myelin is vital for efficient communication: when it deteriorates, as in **multiple sclerosis**, signals are disrupted, leading to muscular weakness, loss of coordination, and even paralysis.\n\nAt the far end of the axon are **terminal buttons**, small knobs that secrete chemicals called **neurotransmitters**. These neurotransmitters cross the tiny gap — the **synaptic cleft** — to influence the activity of other neurons.\n\nAlthough neurons are the stars of the show, they’re actually outnumbered by **glial cells**. Glia provide support, nourishment, and insulation for neurons. Once considered only “glue,” recent research shows glia also play a role in communication and may contribute to psychological disorders.\n\n---\n\n### The Neural Impulse\n\nNeurons transmit information through electrical and chemical signals.\n\nAt rest, a neuron maintains a small negative charge relative to its outside environment. This state, called the **resting potential**, is about -70 millivolts. Like a battery, the neuron stores potential energy.\n\nWhen a neuron is stimulated strongly enough, it triggers an **action potential**. During an action potential:\n- The cell membrane momentarily opens, allowing positively charged sodium ions to rush in.\n- This causes the inside of the neuron to briefly become positive.\n- The action potential then travels down the axon, a process called **propagation**.\n\nAfter the impulse passes, the cell enters a **refractory period**, where it can’t fire again until it resets its resting potential.\n\nTwo important principles:\n- **The All-or-None Law:** Neurons either fire completely or not at all.\n- **Rate Coding:** A stronger stimulus does not create a bigger impulse, but it can cause a neuron to fire more frequently or cause more neurons to fire.\n\nBecause of **myelination**, impulses move much faster in myelinated axons. The signal actually jumps between gaps in the sheath called **nodes of Ranvier**, a process known as **saltatory conduction**.\n\n---\n\n### The Synapse\n\nNeurons do not touch each other directly. Instead, they meet at **synapses** — junctions where information passes from one neuron to the next.\n\nA synapse has three components:\n1. The **presynaptic neuron** (sending cell), with its terminal buttons.\n2. The **synaptic cleft**, the tiny gap between neurons (about 20–40 nanometers wide).\n3. The **postsynaptic neuron** (receiving cell), with receptor sites on its dendrites.\n\nWhen the action potential reaches the terminal buttons, it triggers the release of **neurotransmitters** stored in small sacs called **synaptic vesicles**. These chemicals spill into the synaptic cleft and drift across to bind with receptor sites on the postsynaptic cell.\n\nThe binding of neurotransmitters is selective — a given neurotransmitter can only bind to certain receptors, like a key fitting into a lock. Depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor, the postsynaptic neuron’s potential is shifted either positively (**excitatory**) or negatively (**inhibitory**).\n\nAfterward, neurotransmitters are usually:\n- **Inactivated by enzymes**, or\n- **Reabsorbed** by the presynaptic cell in a process called **reuptake**.\n\nThis recycling allows efficient communication and prevents neurotransmitters from clogging the synapse.\n\n---\n\n### Neurotransmitters and Behavior\n\nNeurotransmitters are critical to almost every aspect of behavior. Several are especially important in psychology:\n\n- **Acetylcholine (ACh):** the only transmitter between motor neurons and voluntary muscles. It also contributes to arousal, attention, and memory. A shortage of ACh is linked to Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n- **Dopamine (DA):** involved in voluntary movement and the brain’s reward system. Abnormal dopamine activity is implicated in Parkinson’s disease (low dopamine) and schizophrenia (high dopamine activity). Dopamine pathways are also central to addictive behaviors.\n\n- **Norepinephrine (NE):** regulates mood and arousal. Abnormal NE levels are associated with depressive disorders.\n\n- **Serotonin (5-HT):** contributes to sleep, appetite, mood, and aggression. Low serotonin levels are tied to depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders.\n\n- **GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid):** the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, calming excessive neural activity. Low GABA activity is linked to anxiety disorders.\n\n- **Glutamate:** the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, important in learning and memory. Excessive glutamate can contribute to seizures.\n\n- **Endorphins:** resemble opiates in structure and effects. They play a key role in pain relief and also in producing pleasurable feelings, such as the “runner’s high.”\n\nThe nervous system’s delicate balance depends on the proper functioning of these neurotransmitters. Drugs and toxins can interfere with them — either mimicking their effects (agonists) or blocking them (antagonists)."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"6451499B-8954-445A-B5C8-0E2E01D806B2","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 3.2_Book","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Section 3.2","answer":"# 📖 Psychology: Themes and Variations – Chapter 3\n### 3.2 – Organization of the Nervous System\n\nThe nervous system is divided into two main parts: the **Central Nervous System (CNS)** and the **Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)**. Together, they form an integrated network that coordinates every action and thought.\n\n---\n\n### The Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)\n\nThe PNS includes all the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. Its main role is to carry information to and from the CNS. The PNS is further divided into two subsystems:\n\n1. **The Somatic Nervous System**  \n   - Controls voluntary muscles and transmits sensory information.  \n   - Sensory (afferent) nerves carry messages from the skin, muscles, and joints to the CNS.  \n   - Motor (efferent) nerves carry commands from the CNS to the skeletal muscles, allowing you to walk, write, or play an instrument.  \n\n2. **The Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)**  \n   - Controls involuntary functions like heart rate, digestion, and gland activity.  \n   - Works largely outside conscious control.  \n   - The ANS has two branches with opposite effects:\n\n   - **Sympathetic Division**:  \n     - Mobilizes energy during emergencies — the “fight or flight” response.  \n     - Increases heart rate, dilates pupils, inhibits digestion, releases stored energy.  \n     - Prepares the body to face a threat or challenge.  \n\n   - **Parasympathetic Division**:  \n     - Conserves energy and restores normal function after stress.  \n     - Slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, stimulates digestion.  \n     - Nicknamed “rest and digest.”  \n\nThe balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems maintains homeostasis.  \n\n---\n\n### The Central Nervous System (CNS)\n\nThe CNS consists of the **brain** and **spinal cord**. It is protected by bone (skull and vertebral column), three layers of membranes called the meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions and nourishes neural tissue.\n\n- **The Spinal Cord**  \n  - A communication highway linking the brain with the body.  \n  - Contains bundles of axons carrying incoming (afferent) and outgoing (efferent) information.  \n  - Also controls simple reflexes without brain involvement. For example, touching a hot stove triggers a withdrawal reflex through the spinal cord before the sensation reaches conscious awareness.  \n\n- **The Brain**  \n  - The control center of the nervous system.  \n  - Responsible for perception, movement, thought, emotion, memory, and consciousness.  \n  - Composed of billions of neurons forming intricate circuits.  \n  - Different regions specialize in different functions but work together as an integrated whole.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Point\n\nThe organization of the nervous system ensures efficient communication. The **PNS** connects the body to the **CNS**, while the **CNS** integrates information and directs responses. The autonomic system’s dual branches prepare the body for emergencies and restore balance afterward."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"31F0AE43-6220-4503-85FC-358771B5D6FF","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 3.3_Book","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Section 3.3","answer":"# 📖 Psychology: Themes and Variations – Chapter 3\n### 3.3 – Looking Inside the Brain: Research Methods\n\nUnderstanding the brain requires tools that let researchers explore its structure and function. Historically, much of what we knew about the brain came from observing injuries or performing surgical procedures on animals. Today, advanced technologies allow scientists to study the living brain in both humans and animals.\n\n---\n\n### Early Methods: Lesioning and Electrical Stimulation\n\n- **Lesioning**: In this method, researchers deliberately destroy a piece of the brain. A high-frequency electric current is applied through an electrode to burn and disable targeted brain tissue. Observing the resulting behavioral changes reveals the role of that brain area.  \n\n- **Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB)**: Instead of destroying tissue, a weak electrical current is applied through an electrode. This stimulates neurons in a specific region. Sometimes ESB produces behaviors similar to those triggered naturally.  \n\nThese early methods laid the foundation for identifying connections between brain regions and behavior, though they were mostly limited to animal research.\n\n---\n\n### Brain Imaging Techniques\n\nModern neuroscience relies heavily on imaging technologies that let researchers peer inside the living brain safely.\n\n1. **Electroencephalograph (EEG)**  \n   - Records electrical activity from the brain through electrodes attached to the scalp.  \n   - Measures brain-wave patterns.  \n   - Useful for studying states of consciousness such as sleep, alertness, and dreaming.  \n   - Also applied in diagnosing brain damage, epilepsy, and neurological disorders.  \n\n2. **Computerized Tomography (CT or CAT scan)**  \n   - Uses X-ray images combined by a computer to create a detailed picture of brain structure.  \n   - Provides information about brain abnormalities such as tumors, injuries, or structural damage.  \n   - Offers better resolution than standard X-rays.  \n\n3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**  \n   - Uses magnetic fields, radio waves, and computerized enhancement to create high-resolution images.  \n   - Produces a 3D picture of the brain with much greater clarity than CT scans.  \n   - Excellent for detecting subtle brain abnormalities.  \n\n4. **Positron Emission Tomography (PET scan)**  \n   - Uses radioactive markers injected into the bloodstream to map chemical activity in the brain.  \n   - Shows which brain areas are active during specific tasks, such as speaking or problem-solving.  \n   - Provides insight into neurotransmitter activity.  \n\n5. **Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)**  \n   - The most advanced and widely used imaging technique.  \n   - Detects blood flow and oxygen consumption in the brain in real time.  \n   - Allows researchers to see both structure and activity simultaneously.  \n   - Useful for mapping brain regions involved in language, memory, emotions, and decision-making.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Point\n\nBrain research has advanced from destructive methods like lesioning to powerful non-invasive imaging techniques. These tools allow scientists to link brain activity with behavior, paving the way for breakthroughs in understanding mental processes and psychological disorders."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"AB009F7F-59D7-4CFD-B1D8-9BD74A8E2BED","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 3.4_Book","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Section 3.4","answer":"# 📖 Psychology: Themes and Variations – Chapter 3\n### 3.4 – Mapping the Brain and Behavior\n\nNow that scientists have tools to look inside the brain, they can study the relationship between specific brain structures and behavior. This section introduces the major divisions of the brain and their roles.\n\n---\n\n### The Hindbrain: Basic Life Functions\n\nThe **hindbrain** is located at the base of the skull and is responsible for vital, unconscious processes.\n\n- **Medulla**: Controls essential functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood circulation. Damage to the medulla is often fatal.  \n- **Pons**: Connects the brainstem with the cerebellum and plays a role in sleep, arousal, and regulating breathing.  \n- **Cerebellum**: A large, folded structure behind the brainstem. Involved in coordination of movement, balance, and fine motor skills. Damage to the cerebellum disrupts motor control and can affect speech and cognition.  \n\n---\n\n### The Midbrain: Sensory Processing and Movement\n\nThe **midbrain** sits above the hindbrain and is involved in integrating sensory processes such as vision and hearing.  \n\nIt also contains the **reticular formation**, a network of fibers that runs through the brainstem. The reticular formation regulates sleep, arousal, and attention. It acts as a filter, helping the brain decide which sensory information is important.\n\n---\n\n### The Forebrain: The Seat of Complex Functions\n\nThe **forebrain** is the largest and most complex region, responsible for higher-order processes.\n\n- **Thalamus**: Acts as a relay station. All sensory information (except smell) passes through the thalamus before being sent to appropriate areas of the cortex.  \n- **Hypothalamus**: A small structure beneath the thalamus. Involved in regulating basic biological drives — hunger, thirst, temperature control, sexual behavior, and aggression. It also links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.  \n- **Limbic System**: A collection of structures involved in emotion, motivation, memory, and learning. Key components include:  \n  - **Hippocampus**: Critical for forming new memories and spatial navigation.  \n  - **Amygdala**: Plays a central role in processing emotions, especially fear and aggression.  \n  - **Other Limbic Structures**: Contribute to motivation and reward.  \n\n---\n\n### The Cerebrum: The “Thinking” Brain\n\nThe **cerebrum** is the largest part of the brain, accounting for about 70% of its volume. It is divided into two halves, called the **cerebral hemispheres**, connected by a bundle of fibers known as the **corpus callosum**. The hemispheres communicate constantly but often specialize in different tasks (a phenomenon called **lateralization**).\n\nThe **cerebral cortex** is the outer layer of the cerebrum, composed of billions of neurons. It is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci), increasing its surface area. The cortex is responsible for the most sophisticated mental activities.\n\nEach hemisphere is divided into **four lobes**:\n\n1. **Occipital Lobe**  \n   - Located at the back of the brain.  \n   - Responsible for processing visual information. Damage may cause blindness or visual disturbances.  \n\n2. **Parietal Lobe**  \n   - Located at the top of the brain.  \n   - Processes sensations such as touch, pressure, and pain.  \n   - Contains the **primary somatosensory cortex**, which maps body sensations.  \n\n3. **Temporal Lobe**  \n   - Located on the sides of the brain, near the temples.  \n   - Processes auditory information.  \n   - Contains areas important for language comprehension and memory.  \n\n4. **Frontal Lobe**  \n   - Located at the front of the brain.  \n   - Involved in decision-making, planning, self-control, and personality.  \n   - Contains the **primary motor cortex**, which controls voluntary movements.  \n   - The **prefrontal cortex** is especially important for higher-order functions such as reasoning, judgment, and working memory.  \n\n---\n\n### Key Point\n\nThe brain is organized into regions that specialize in different functions, from basic survival processes to complex thought.

Define data and statistics.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Data**: Collected observations from scientific study.  \n- **Statistics**: Mathematical tools used to analyze data.\n\n---\n\n15. Describe types of graphs and distributions.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Frequency distributions**: Show how often values occur.  \n- **Line graphs & bar graphs**: Summarize data visually.  \n- **Scatter plots**: Show relationship between two variables.  \n- **Best-fit line**: Represents trend in scatter plot.\n\n---\n\n16. Describe and calculate measures of central tendency.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Mean (average):** Add all numbers, divide by how many there are.  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 → Mean = (2+4+6+8+10) ÷ 5 = 6.  \n\n- **Median (middle value):** Order numbers, pick the middle.  \n  Example: Scores = 3, 5, 7, 9, 20 → Median = 7.  \n  (If even number of scores, average the two middle values).  \n\n- **Mode (most frequent value):**  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 9 → Mode = 3.  \n\n**When to use each:**  \n- **Mean** = best when data are evenly distributed without extreme outliers.  \n- **Median** = best when there are extreme scores\/skewed data.  \n- **Mode** = best with categorical or non-numerical data (e.g., favorite color, most common car type) or when identifying the most frequent outcome.\n\n---\n\n17. Explain when it is better to use the median.  \n**Answer:**  \nWhen data include **outliers** or are skewed.  \nExample: Household incomes = $30k, $32k, $35k, $40k, $1,000,000.  \n- Mean ≈ $227k (misleading).  \n- Median = $35k (better reflection of “typical” income).\n\n---\n\n18. Explain when to use the mode.  \n**Answer:**  \nWhen data are **categorical** or when the most common response is important.  \nExamples:  \n- Shoe size most commonly sold = Mode = 9.  \n- Favorite ice cream flavor survey: Mode = Vanilla.  \n- Multiple modes possible (bimodal\/multimodal distributions).\n\n---\n\n19. Describe how scores cluster into a normal curve and measures of variation.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Normal distribution**: Bell-shaped curve; most scores fall near the mean, fewer at the extremes.  \n- **Range**: Difference between highest and lowest score.  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 5, 8, 10 → Range = 10 – 2 = 8.  \n- **Spread**: General term for how “wide” the data are.  \n- **Standard deviation (SD):** Measures average distance of scores from the mean.  \n  - Small SD = scores clustered tightly around mean.  \n  - Large SD = scores spread out, less consistent.\n\n---\n\n20. Explain importance of small vs. large standard deviation.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Small SD**: More consistency (e.g., student test scores all near 85).  \n- **Large SD**: More variability, less predictability (e.g., scores from 50–100).  \nLarge SD can also indicate **outliers**.\n\n---\n\n21. Discuss the correlation coefficient (r).  \n**Answer:**  \n- Ranges from **-1.0 to +1.0**.  \n- Closer to ±1 = stronger relationship.  \n- **Positive correlation**: both variables increase\/decrease together.  \n- **Negative correlation**: one increases while the other decreases.  \n- **Zero correlation**: no relationship.\n\n---\n\n22. Identify positive, negative, and zero correlation.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Positive**: Hours studied ↑ and grades ↑.  \n- **Negative**: Stress ↑ and immune function ↓.  \n- **Zero**: Shoe size and IQ.\n\n---\n\n23. Describe the null and alternative hypothesis.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** Predicts no relationship or no difference. Example: “Studying has no effect on exam performance.”  \n- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** Predicts a relationship or difference exists. Example: “Students who study will score higher than those who don’t.”  \n**Key points:**  \n- The null is tested statistically by default.  \n- Researchers try to reject the null in favor of the alternative.  \n- Rejecting the null means results are unlikely due to chance alone.  \n- Failure to reject the null ≠ proof it is true, only that evidence was insufficient.\n\n---\n\n24. Explain statistical significance.  \n**Answer:**  \nA result is **statistically significant** if it is unlikely to occur by chance (typically p < .05).  \nThis means there is less than a 5% probability that results are random, so the findings are considered reliable and meaningful."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"222B64ED-E0CB-4136-AFA4-015053F18EDF","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 2_Exam_Study_2","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Chapter 2 study part 2","answer":"# 📖 PSYC1001 – Chapter 2 (with Appendix B)\n## Research Enterprise of Psychology – Expanded & Clarified Study Guide\n\n---\n\n8. Describe the experimental method: IV, DV, control groups, and experimental groups.  \n**Answer:**  \nThe experimental method is the **only research design that can demonstrate cause-and-effect**.  \n- **Independent variable (IV):** The variable the researcher manipulates. Example: number of hours studied.  \n- **Dependent variable (DV):** The outcome measured. Example: test score.  \n- **Experimental group:** Receives the manipulation (studies 5 hours).  \n- **Control group:** Does not receive the manipulation (studies 0 hours).  \n**Why it matters:** By comparing groups, the researcher can conclude whether the IV caused changes in the DV. Random assignment ensures fairness and reduces bias.\n\n---\n\n9. Explain why sampling bias, self-report data, experimenter bias, and extraneous variables are issues.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Sampling bias:** When the sample does not represent the population. Example: studying only college students and applying results to all adults.  \n- **Self-report bias:** People may lie, forget, or answer in a socially desirable way (e.g., underreporting alcohol use).  \n- **Experimenter bias:** Researcher’s expectations unintentionally influence participants or data collection (can be minimized by double-blind procedures).  \n- **Extraneous variables (confounds):** Uncontrolled factors that may influence the DV (e.g., testing one group in the morning and another at night).  \n**Solutions:** Random sampling, random assignment, blinding, placebos, and standardized procedures.\n\n---\n\n16. Measures of central tendency – Mean, Median, Mode (with examples).  \n\n**Mean (average):**  \n- How to calculate: Add all scores and divide by the number of scores.  \n  Example: Scores = 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 → Mean = (10+12+14+16+18) ÷ 5 = 14.  \n- When to use: Best when data are evenly distributed without outliers.  \n- Example scenario: Calculating the **average exam score** for a class to represent overall performance.\n\n**Median (middle score):**  \n- How to calculate: Order scores from lowest to highest and find the middle value.  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 5, 7, 12, 30 → Median = 7.  \n  If even number of scores, average the two middle ones.  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 5, 7, 12 → Median = (5+7) ÷ 2 = 6.  \n- When to use: Best with **skewed data** or extreme outliers.  \n- Example scenario: Reporting **household income**. The mean income is often distorted by billionaires, but the median shows the “typical” family income.\n\n**Mode (most frequent value):**  \n- How to calculate: Identify the value that appears most often.  \n  Example: Scores = 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7 → Mode = 6.  \n  If two numbers tie, it is **bimodal**; if more, **multimodal**.  \n- When to use: Best with **categorical data** or when the most common outcome is important.  \n- Example scenario: Shoe company checks sales → Sizes sold = 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10 → Mode = size 8. The company stocks more size 8s because it’s the most frequently purchased.\n\n---\n\n17. Explain when it is better to use the median.  \n**Answer:**  \nUse the **median** when extreme values skew the data.  \nExample: Incomes = $20k, $25k, $30k, $35k, $2,000,000.  \n- Mean = $422,000 (misleading).  \n- Median = $30k (better indicator of typical income).  \n\n---\n\n18. Explain when to use the mode.  \n**Answer:**  \nUse the **mode** when data are categorical or when the most common option matters.  \nExamples:  \n- Clothing retailer: The most commonly sold T-shirt size is Medium → Mode = Medium.  \n- Favorite pet survey: Results show Dog (40), Cat (30), Fish (10), Bird (5) → Mode = Dog.  \n- Shoe sales: Sizes 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9 → Mode = 8. Retailers stock more of size 8.\n\n---\n\n19. Describe how scores cluster into a normal curve and measures of variation.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Normal distribution:** Bell-shaped curve where most scores cluster around the mean, with fewer at extremes. Example: Heights of adult men (most ~5’8”–5’10”, fewer very short\/tall).  \n- **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest value. Example: Scores = 50, 60, 70, 100 → Range = 100 – 50 = 50.  \n- **Spread:** General term for how “wide” data are distributed.  \n- **Standard deviation (SD):** Tells how much scores vary from the mean.  \n  - Small SD: Scores tightly clustered (students scoring 78, 79, 80, 81).  \n  - Large SD: Scores widely spread (50, 65, 75, 95).  \n\n---\n\n20. Explain importance of small vs. large standard deviation.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Small SD:** Indicates consistency and predictability (e.g., baseball player consistently hitting .300).  \n- **Large SD:** Indicates unpredictability and variability (e.g., one exam score at 50 and another at 100).  \nLarge SDs often highlight **outliers**.\n\n---\n\n23. Describe the null and alternative hypothesis.  \n**Answer:**  \n- **Null hypothesis (H₀):** Predicts no effect or no difference. Example: “Caffeine has no effect on memory recall.”  \n- **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** Predicts there is an effect. Example: “Caffeine improves memory recall.”  \n\n**Additional Explanation:**  \n- Researchers always start by assuming the null is true.  \n- The goal of research is to **test evidence against the null**.  \n- If results are strong enough (statistically significant), we **reject the null** in favor of the alternative.  \n- Importantly, **failing to reject the null does not prove it true** — it only means the evidence was not strong enough to support the alternative.  \n- Example: If a memory experiment finds p < .05, the researcher rejects the null and concludes caffeine likely affects recall. If p > .05, they fail to reject the null (but cannot claim caffeine has “no effect” with certainty)."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"2BFDE7DB-C9F7-4EDA-A834-371B888CCAE8","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 1","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Premise that knowledge should be acquired through observation.?","answer":"Empiricism."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"0D45F5C9-4E9A-4327-984E-EE8111DD5C09","repetitions":0,"course":"Intro Artificial Intelligence ","chapter":"Mod 2","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Module 2 Study Guide","answer":"# 📘 Study Guide – Intro to AI (Module 2: Domains of AI)\n\n## 1.

Before diving into them, it helps to ask, *how do we categorize AI at all?* One way is to look at the application — what is the system being used for? Another is to examine the tools and algorithms — the mathematical and engineering techniques behind it. Finally, we can categorize by the type of data involved, whether it is images, text, or numerical datasets.\n\n**Computer Vision: Seeing the World**  \nComputer vision is a field of AI, computer science, and engineering that enables machines to see and interpret the world. A digital image is simply an array of pixels, and a video is just a sequence of those images. Through computer vision, machines extract information from those pixels, recognize patterns, and act upon them. The goal is to emulate human vision — not just to “see,” but to identify, process, analyze, predict, and even make recommendations.\n\n**Tasks in Computer Vision**  \nThe tasks in computer vision are diverse. Image classification assigns a label to an entire image, such as detecting if a photo contains a cat or dog. Object detection goes further by both recognizing what is present and locating it, for example, a self-driving car spotting pedestrians and traffic signs. Image segmentation breaks an image into regions and labels each pixel — in semantic segmentation, pixels are grouped by category, while in instance segmentation, each separate object is identified. Other advanced tasks include image and video captioning, where AI generates natural descriptions; visual question answering, where the system answers questions about an image; action recognition in videos, such as classifying sports moves or spotting suspicious behavior; pose estimation to track human movement; and image restoration, which improves or fills in missing visual details.\n\n**Natural Language Processing: Understanding Language**  \nNatural language processing, or NLP, is the branch of AI that deals with human language. Language is nuanced, context-dependent, and often ambiguous. For example, the word *red* might mean a color, a surname, or a state of embarrassment. The word *crane* might describe a bird or a machine. Computers prefer structured data, and NLP bridges this gap by teaching machines to understand, process, and generate language. With NLP, machines can read, write, listen, and even converse with us.\n\n**Applications of NLP**  \nNLP powers many everyday technologies. Text classification can filter spam emails. Sentiment analysis measures the emotional tone of a text. Machine translation allows us to automatically convert between languages. Text summarization condenses long documents into shorter versions. Chatbots and conversational agents generate human-like responses. Other applications include autocorrect in writing, automatic speech recognition that turns speech into text, and text-to-speech systems that give machines a human-like voice. These tools are behind the predictive text on your phone, as well as voice assistants like Siri or Alexa.\n\n**Statistical Data: The Foundation**  \nStatistical data may not seem as exciting as computer vision or NLP, but it is the backbone of much of AI. It refers to information that has been collected, organized, and analyzed to describe or understand phenomena. Imagine survey responses that are transformed into a structured table — this is statistical data at work. It is measurable, collected with purpose, designed to reveal patterns, and ideally representative of the population being studied.\n\n**Types of Variables and Predictions**  \nIn statistical data, we usually deal with two types of variables. Categorical variables include attributes like gender, ethnicity, or movie genre. Numerical variables include values like age, house price, or the length of a flower petal. Prediction tasks also fall into two categories: classification and regression. Classification predicts categories — such as spam or not spam — while regression predicts numerical values, like forecasting stock prices or house values. A well-known example is the Boston Housing dataset, where features like crime rate, air quality, and pupil–teacher ratios are used to predict the median home value in a neighborhood.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nTo summarize, computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical data form the foundation of modern AI. Each has its own challenges and applications, but together they demonstrate the versatility of artificial intelligence. From teaching machines to see, to enabling them to understand language, to uncovering patterns in raw numbers, these domains define what AI can do today and where it may take us tomorrow."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"49FC3A0D-1986-4961-9ED5-0FBA0D8BEC8C","repetitions":0,"course":"Intro Artificial Intelligence ","chapter":"Mod 3_Long","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Module 3_Long","answer":"# Module 3: Artificial Intelligence in Industries\n\n**Introduction**  \nArtificial intelligence is not confined to labs and research papers — it is shaping entire industries around the world. In this module, we look at how AI is transforming eight major sectors: retail, agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, transportation, education, and banking. For each of these industries, we will review the problems they face and then explore the AI-driven solutions that are changing how they operate.\n\n**AI in Retail**  \nRetail is one of the largest industries in the United States, supporting over 52 million jobs and contributing trillions to the economy. Yet, it faces intense pressure from online competitors, evolving customer expectations, and the challenge of retaining both customers and employees in a post-pandemic landscape. AI has offered solutions such as cashier-less stores like Amazon Go, which use computer vision and shelf sensors to track what customers pick up, allowing a seamless walk-in and walk-out experience. Other innovations include retail robots like LoweBot, which can navigate aisles, help customers find products, and communicate using natural language processing. These technologies not only make shopping more efficient but also reshape the customer experience.\n\n**AI in Agriculture**  \nAgriculture remains a backbone of society, employing millions and feeding populations, yet it faces daunting problems. Climate change, soil erosion, biodiversity loss, and the demand for sustainable food production weigh heavily on the industry. AI is helping farmers monitor soil health, predict weather patterns, and decide when to irrigate, fertilize, or apply pesticides with precision. In some regions, drones equipped with computer vision are used to target pesticide application, reducing waste and environmental impact. AI systems can also detect plant diseases early, giving farmers a chance to intervene before entire crops are lost. In Israel and Europe, drones and robotic harvesters use object detection and segmentation to pick crops efficiently, addressing labor shortages and sustainability goals.\n\n**AI in Healthcare**  \nHealthcare is a massive and complex industry, with over 20 million workers in the U.S. alone. It faces rising costs, staff shortages, burnout, and the challenge of providing high-quality, accessible care. AI is making an impact in several ways. Reinforcement learning has enabled the development of prosthetic limbs that adapt and learn to mimic natural human movement. Chatbots like Wysa and Sensely provide mental health support and assist patients in navigating care systems. Medical imaging has seen remarkable advances through tools like GE’s SonoSamTrack and Canon’s AiCE, which use deep learning to improve the clarity and precision of ultrasound, CT, and MR scans. AI is also revolutionizing drug discovery: instead of testing millions of compounds in labs, machine learning models can screen and optimize candidates virtually, drastically reducing development time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI-assisted platforms helped accelerate treatments like Pfizer’s Paxlovid. Even large language models, such as GPT-4, are being tested to simplify medical consent forms, ensuring patients better understand their care.\n\n**AI in Manufacturing**  \nManufacturing contributes over 11% of U.S. output and employs millions, but it struggles with skilled labor shortages, global competition, and the need to balance cost, speed, and quality. AI addresses these challenges in several ways. Computer vision systems are deployed to monitor worker safety, ensuring employees wear protective equipment and stay clear of dangerous zones. AI is also used in quality control — tools like WiseEye and Cognex leverage deep learning to detect tiny defects in materials, preventing costly recalls and improving efficiency on production lines. These applications highlight AI’s ability to boost both safety and productivity in factories.\n\n**AI in Energy**  \nThe energy sector is critical to every modern economy but is under increasing strain. It employs nearly 7 million Americans and faces challenges such as rising demand, limited oil supply, environmental concerns, and the unpredictability of renewable sources. AI provides powerful tools here. Smart grids, managed by AI, balance demand and supply in real time, ensuring energy flows efficiently. DeepMind developed models that predict wind energy output up to 36 hours in advance, allowing renewable energy to be stored and distributed more effectively. Companies like Stem use AI to help firms store renewable energy intelligently, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and cutting emissions. AI is thus central to the transition toward a cleaner and more reliable energy future.\n\n**AI in Transportation**  \nTransportation, encompassing air, rail, road, and shipping, is vital to global trade and mobility. Yet, it faces issues of safety, congestion, and driver shortages. AI has been at the center of many breakthroughs. Tesla’s Autopilot and Uber’s DeepETA are examples of AI systems that power autonomous driving and predict arrival times with impressive accuracy. Companies are even testing flying drone taxis for urban mobility. At the same time, everyday tools like Google Maps use AI to forecast traffic patterns and suggest alternate routes. In China, Didi uses AI-driven facial recognition to detect drowsy drivers, reducing accidents. Meanwhile, Nuro has developed delivery robots for groceries and prepared meals, changing how goods reach consumers.\n\n**AI in Education**  \nEducation employs millions of teachers and affects every household. Yet, schools face overcrowding, outdated teaching methods, funding constraints, and student mental health challenges. AI is already helping fill these gaps. At George Washington University, the MARTHA chatbot answers student questions. Georgia Tech developed Jill Watson, an AI teaching assistant capable of supporting students in online courses. Platforms like ALEKS adaptively assess each student’s comprehension, providing personalized learning pathways that adjust in real time. These systems help extend the reach of educators and provide students with more tailored support.\n\n**AI in Banking and Finance**  \nFinally, let’s consider banking and finance — industries that underpin the entire economy. With nearly two million employees in the U.S., this sector faces competition, regulatory demands, and ever-growing security risks. AI is being applied widely: Erica, a chatbot at Bank of America, serves millions of customers and handles a wide range of inquiries. Ocrolus provides document analysis, helping banks verify data and detect fraud quickly. ZestFinance uses AI to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers who may lack traditional credit histories. BloombergGPT, a financial large language model, generates sentiment analysis from news and reports, classifies articles by topic, and even produces concise financial headlines. These innovations streamline operations, strengthen security, and improve decision-making across finance.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nAcross retail, agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, energy, transportation, education, and banking, AI is revolutionizing how industries operate. It helps solve pressing problems, from sustainability and safety to efficiency and personalization. Each application demonstrates that artificial intelligence is not just a technology of the future — it is an active force transforming the way we live and work today."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"439183EC-9EBB-4658-8128-E405320E298D","repetitions":0,"course":"Intro Artificial Intelligence ","chapter":"Mod 1_Long","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"Module 1 Long","answer":"# Module 1: History and Evolution of Artificial Intelligence\n\n**Introduction**  \nArtificial intelligence is one of the most fascinating and fast-moving fields of our time. But to understand where we are today, it’s important to begin with its foundations. In this module, we will define what AI is, look at its pioneers, distinguish AI from automation, discuss narrow versus general intelligence, examine the limitations of AI, trace its history, and finally study how AI has evolved into the systems we see today.\n\n**Defining Artificial Intelligence**  \nAI has been defined in many ways over the years, and no single definition captures its full scope. Max Tegmark once called it “intelligence that is not biological.” John McCarthy, one of AI’s founding figures, described it as “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” Nils Nilsson defined it as the activity devoted to making machines intelligent — where intelligence is the ability to function appropriately and with foresight in an environment. Rodney Brooks took a more practical view, arguing that AI is not one thing but a collection of practices and components assembled by humans. Together, these perspectives remind us that AI is not just software or code; it is a branch of computer science devoted to giving machines the ability to mimic human intelligence. It is about solving problems, adapting to new situations, and creating value across cultural contexts.\n\n**Prominent AI Scientists**  \nThe early pioneers of AI laid the foundation for the field we know today. John McCarthy, who coined the very term “Artificial Intelligence” in 1955, developed the LISP programming language and founded the Stanford AI Lab. For his contributions, he was awarded the prestigious Turing Award in 1971. Alan Turing, often called the father of modern computer science, contributed not only to codebreaking during World War II but also to the theoretical underpinnings of AI. In 1936, he introduced the Turing machine, a model of computation, and in 1950, he devised the famous Turing Test, which asked: *Can a machine exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human?* This test, also known as the imitation game, remains a benchmark for assessing AI today.\n\n**AI vs. Automation**  \nIt is important to distinguish AI from automation. Automation refers to software or hardware capable of carrying out routine tasks without human intervention. It replaces human involvement in well-defined, repetitive systems. Artificial intelligence, however, goes further. AI is not just about doing tasks automatically but about learning, reasoning, and making intelligent decisions. In short, automation follows explicit programming, while AI learns from data and adapts to new contexts.\n\n**Narrow vs. General Intelligence**  \nMost of the AI we see in daily life is what we call *Artificial Narrow Intelligence* (ANI), sometimes referred to as Weak AI. These systems are trained to perform specific tasks — such as recognizing faces, recommending movies, or translating languages. By contrast, *Artificial General Intelligence* (AGI) would be an intelligence on par with human beings. AGI could perform a wide variety of tasks: recognizing objects, driving a car, composing music, or holding conversations, all with self-awareness and adaptability. To classify AI, researchers often consider two factors: performance relative to a skilled human, and generality, or how many different tasks it can perform. This taxonomy helps us distinguish narrow AI from the broader ambition of achieving general intelligence.\n\n**Limitations of AI**  \nDespite its progress, AI has real limitations. First, AI is data-dependent. If training data is incomplete or biased, the system’s performance will reflect those flaws. Access to large, clean datasets remains a major obstacle. Second, AI can be costly. Training large models requires expensive hardware — for example, state-of-the-art GPUs can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and training large language models can take millions of GPU hours. Third, AI suffers from transparency problems. It is often difficult to explain why a system reached a certain decision, especially in critical areas like healthcare or finance. Ethical and safety concerns are also pressing: issues of privacy, bias, and responsible use must be addressed. Finally, AI lacks creativity, emotional understanding, common sense, and consciousness. It can mimic these traits, but it does not truly possess them. These limitations highlight the need for continued research and responsible development practices.\n\n**History of AI**  \nThe history of AI can be divided into distinct eras. In the 1950s, Alan Turing’s influential paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” (1950) and the Dartmouth Conference (1956) marked the birth of AI. The 1960s saw early programs like IBM’s Shoebox speech recognizer and ELIZA, an early chatbot. But in the 1970s and 1980s, the field suffered “AI winters,” when funding and enthusiasm declined. Still, advances like Prolog, expert systems, and early convolutional neural networks kept research alive. The 1990s marked a resurgence, highlighted by IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.  \n\nIn the 2000s, the machine learning era took off. Geoffrey Hinton published key work on deep neural networks, and the ImageNet database (2009) fueled computer vision breakthroughs. IBM’s Watson won Jeopardy! in 2011, and Google’s self-driving car project demonstrated AI in action. The 2010s saw deep learning explode, with AlexNet (2012), GANs (2014), and AlphaGo (2016) capturing headlines. OpenAI was founded in 2015, and deepfakes emerged by 2017. By the 2020s, AI achieved even more milestones: GPT-3 (2020), AlphaFold’s protein prediction breakthrough, diffusion models for image generation, and the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Today, AI is both celebrated for its achievements and scrutinized for its ethical implications.\n\n**Evolution of AI**  \nThe evolution of AI is best understood in three phases. First came neural networks, inspired by the human brain, with roots going back to Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. Then came machine learning, where systems learned rules from data and predicted outcomes. Arthur Samuel coined the term “machine learning” in 1959, and this paradigm dominated from the 1980s to 2010. Finally, deep learning emerged as modern AI — using massive datasets and layered neural networks to perform tasks like image recognition, language generation, and decision-making at human-like levels.\n\n**Pioneers of Modern AI**  \nSeveral modern scientists have driven AI forward. Geoffrey Hinton, sometimes called the Godfather of AI, kept neural networks alive during the 1980s and later led breakthroughs in deep convolutional networks. Yann LeCun, now Chief Scientist at Meta AI, pioneered convolutional neural networks and transformed computer vision. Yoshua Bengio contributed foundational work in recurrent neural networks and was a leader in deep learning research. All three received the Turing Award in 2018. Andrew Ng helped democratize AI through his courses on Coursera and his founding of Deeplearning.ai. Fei-Fei Li created ImageNet, which became the backbone of computer vision research. Ian Goodfellow invented Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), advancing generative AI. Together, these pioneers shaped the field we recognize today.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nModule 1 shows us that AI is both an ancient dream and a modern achievement. From Turing and McCarthy to Hinton and Ng, the vision of machines that can think has slowly transformed into reality. But as we’ve seen, AI has limitations and challenges, and its history reminds us that progress is never linear. By learning where AI came from and how it evolved, we are better prepared to understand its role in the present — and its possibilities for the future."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"6F5B74AA-B800-4060-9D6D-43D1D8C0D832","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 2","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"What does “empirical” mean in psychology research?","answer":"Empirical refers to knowledge obtained through direct observation or systematic experimentation rather than pure theory."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"88B0FA85-DC61-4150-9833-D0EF23724148","repetitions":0,"course":"Psychology 101","chapter":"Ch 2","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"What does empiricism emphasize as the source of psychological knowledge?","answer":"Empiricism emphasizes observation and experience as the basis for psychological knowledge."},{"bookmarkedSentences":[],"id":"043B0EBB-9601-4B0C-9FF9-F4821B2B6C12","repetitions":0,"course":"Intro Artificial Intelligence ","chapter":"Mod 2 FlashCards","intervalDays":1,"easeFactor":250,"question":"What type of prediction does regression perform in artificial intelligence?","answer":"Regression predicts continuous numeric values from input features."}]
